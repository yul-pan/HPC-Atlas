HPC-Atlas: Computationally Constructing A Comprehensive Atlas of Human Protein Complexes

Please install the python dependency package before running the clustering programï¼Œsuch as networkx,numpy and so on.

Please Modify the path of input and output files in the clustering program: filename, outfile_first and outfile.

The filename is the input weighted PPI network file.

The outfile_first is the cache file of intermediate results, which can be deleted after the program is completed.

The outfile is the final protein complex file.

Because the PPI file of the whole network is too large, it can only be put into Releases  module and can be downloaded here: https://github.com/yul-pan/HPC-Atlas/releases

For convenience to relevant researchers, all experimental data and result files are presented in the form of UniProtID and Gene name, respectively.
