HPC-Atlas: Computationally Constructing A Comprehensive Atlas of Human Protein Complexes

Please install the python dependency package before running the clustering programï¼Œsuch as networkx,numpy and so on.

Please Modify the path of input and output files in the clustering program: filename, outfile_first and outfile.

The filename is the input weighted PPI network file.

The outfile_first is the cache file of intermediate results, which can be deleted after the program is completed.

The outfile is the final protein complex file.
